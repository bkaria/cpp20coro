# Coroutines

# Coroutines - Definition

>- Coroutines are generalized functions that can pause and resume their execution while keeping their state

# Coroutines - New C++ keywords

>- co_await
>- co_yield
>- co_return

# Coroutines - C++20

* With C++20, we donâ€™t get concrete coroutines,but a framework for implementing coroutines

# Boost ASIO (1.77+)

>- Support for C++20 Coroutines is provided via the awaitable<> class template
>- These facilities allow programs to implement asynchronous logic in a synchronous manner
>- The logical operators || and && have been overloaded for awaitable<>, to allow coroutines to be trivially awaited in parallel.

# Sample App - TCPProxy

# Implementation

>- Traditional ASIO Callbacks
>- Python Asyncio
>- ASIO Coroutines with C++20

# Conclusion
